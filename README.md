# COVID-19 Assignment
This is an assignment submission for Blue Sky Analytics, by Ayush Patra.

I have made this application using React.js. I have used React Hooks, React Router, Axios, React Scroll, and styled components to complete this project.

As a bonus, I've made a live reporting section, where cases around the world are reported and the application checks to see if there has been an increase in active cases for each country everyday.

I have used 2 public APIs for the same, one for covid data and the other for flags.

I have tried to make the website as close as possible to the bluleprint provided. Below are some sample images and a video of the project.
